# Sight-Explorer

Sight-Explorer is one of my personal projects in order to learn the ropes in how to make a small working robot. In this repository I'am going to upload all the futures I add to the robot and also some small tutorials in which I'll explain how to get the project up and runnig on your own robot or machine. Have fun!

## Getting Started

Each folder is a stage of the development of the Sight-Explorer robot. Just jump in the folder you are interested and follow the README.md .
## Working Futures

* Control the robot through SSH with the keyboard.
* Control the robot through the joystick and send the data to the robot through a socket.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - The main programming language
* [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) - Used to read the joystick input.
* [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) - OS on the Raspberry Pi 3
